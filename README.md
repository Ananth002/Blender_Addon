<h1>📝ClearNormal Script Description:</h1>
This script clears custom split normal data from all selected mesh objects in the Blender scene. Custom normals are used to control the shading of a mesh beyond what the geometry alone dictates. Removing them resets the normals back to their default behavior based on mesh topology.
